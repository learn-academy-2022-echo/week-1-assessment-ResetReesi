// ASSESSMENT 1: Coding Conceptual Questions

// Examine the following examples.

// First, predict the outcome based on your understanding of the code.
// Then, uncomment the console.log() and verify the output. Briefly explain why your initial answer was correct or incorrect.

// --------------------INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What will this log?
//const colors = ["tangerine", "magenta", "lilac", "daffodil"]
// console.log(colors.push("indigo"))

// a) Your answer: 
// b) Verify and explain:


// --------------------1) What will this log? 

const cohort = "LEARN 2022"
console.log(cohort.length)

// a) Your answer: 10

// b) Verify and explain:  Once this code is executed it will log the length of the string "LEARN 2022" Which will result in the number 10 because the computer will count every letter including the white space.

       


// -------------------2) What will this log? 



// a) Your answer: O
// b) Verify and explain: I remember square brackets are for an array. So the since arrays index at O. The first letter H with be 0 and counting up to four you will reach the letter O. 


// --------------------3) What will this log?

const languages = ["JavaScript", "Ruby", "Python", "C++"]
const index = languages[1]
console.log(index)

// a) Your answer: Ruby
// b) Verify and explain:  An Array indexes at 0 so thats would make Ruby the index of 1. The computer must log the language at its given index.


// --------------------4) What will this log?

const weekendDays = ["saturday", "sunday"]
console.log(weekendDays.toUpperCase())

// a) Your answer: SATURDAY,SUNDAY
// b) Verify and explain: We are asking the computer to capitalilize saturday and Sunday.


// --------------------5) What will this log?

const dataTypes = ["number", "string", "Boolean"]
console.log(typeof dataTypes.length)

// a) Your answer: It will console log thw word numbers
// b) Verify and explain: it will console log the word number because it askinf for it data type of the .length
