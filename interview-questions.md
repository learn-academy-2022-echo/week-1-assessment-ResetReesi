# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer: 

 conditional statement is based off a mathmatical equation such as a for loop or a boolean

Researched answer: 
   A way for computers to make decisions based on conditions.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: 
   
   Let's start with Github. Github is what I call a cloud- based family tree, Its where my cohorts and I go when we need to build a project together or individually. Git is where I store my personal source code on my personal computer it also helps me keep track of the changed I have made.

Researched answer:

  Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. The difference between Git and GitHub: Git is a widely used version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your code. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage your Git repositories. With GitHub, you can back up your personal files, share your code, and collaborate with others.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: 

   The javaScript operatprs that will return a Boolean value are && (andAnd). If both sides of the condition is satisfied you will use &&. || (or) You use this operator when one or the other condition is true. For the Big Bang (!) you usually use this when the conditions are negated.

Researched answer: 

   The logical OR ( || ) operator (logical disjunction) for a set of operands is true if and only if one or more of its operands is true. It is typically used with boolean (logical) values. When it is, it returns a Boolean value.

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: 

    Index is when the computer is looking for a certain position. A value is when a computer is looking for a specific item.

Researched answer:

    What Is An Index In Computer Programming? Indexes represent the position of items in a sequence by numerical representation. A sequence can be a list, a string of characters, or any arbitrary sequence of values. In mathematics, logic, and computer programming, a value is a definite object.

4. What is iteration?

Your answer:

 Iteration is like the energizer bunny it allows us to simplfy mathamatical equasion by repeating certain steps until told otherwise.

Researched answer:

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: 

    A good description of proper pair programming techniques includes taking turns, it gives you the opportunity to problem solvewhile yout partner learns typing syntax and vice verse-a. Pair programming also helps reduce the number of mistakes made. For example sometimes you can be typing and miss spell a file name your partner will be there to navigate you. Most of the time they correct the mistake before you even finish you line of code. In pair programinf one person is the Navigator and the other perdon is the Driver.

Researched answer: 

Why We Utilize Pair Programming

Different people have different knowledge and strengths which can lead to better solutions
Distributing cognitive load and use individualized skills (typing syntax vs. problem solving) when driving and navigating
Coding can feel overwhelming, so focusing on one aspect of the job at hand can help focus energy on problem solving
Two sets of eyes makes it easier to catch mistakes and produce high-quality code
A pair can hold each other accountable so you'll be less likely to be tempted to take shortcuts or jump around without finishing the task you are on
Partners help keep the focus on coding and not on distractions like texts, emails, etc
Talking about your code with a partner will deepen your understanding of programming
Increased specialization requires more collaboration

Roles: Driver and Navigator
The driver is the one with their hands on the keyboard. They are responsible for entering information and following the instructions given by the navigator. This approach requires constant communication. And talking about your code will make you a better developer and a better teammate. It is important to switch roles every 10-20 minutes and take frequent breaks.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions:
      • Higher order functions are functions passing arguments through other functions that return a new function based on the paramaters

2. Jest:
      • jest is like the console. Its a framework design to test your code.

3. Objects:
      • Objects can be operations, structure, system, unit or a single thing.

4. Method:
      • Method is step ny step instructions that can be performed on programs

5. Classes:
      • Classes are a way to keep code organized. Sorta like a school. All the math symbols and math calculations would attend the Math class.
